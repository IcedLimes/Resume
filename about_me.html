            <h1 style="color:crimson; font-size: x-large">My Goals</h1>
                My name is Jason and I live in the United States of America, I was born in California Walnut Creek, and I now live in Dublin CA<br>
                I am in 9th grade at Emerald High School and have 1 brother and a great mom and dad. <br>
                Throughout my high school career, I want to maintain good grades so that I can major in something like Computer Science or business.<br>
                To achieve my near-impossible goal of being a successful computer scientist I hope to score a good score in the SAT which I will be taking in March 2024.<br>
                not only that but in the next 3 years I hope to maintain a 3.7+ unweighted GPA. This will help me get into a dream college such as UC San Diego.<br>
                Not only will this make my parent proud, but it will also make me a substantial amount of money which will hopefully allow me to retire before the age of 60, and will also let me move to somewhere like Lake Tahoe.<br></p>
        
                <h1 style="color: orange; font-size: x-large">My Accomplishments </h1>
                One of my best strengths is my unbreaking determination to achieve my goal, although I don't have the greatest mind in my head, I am very good at following through with what I want or say I will do.<br>
                This makes me a very good worker as long as I am focused on something I believe that I need to accomplish.<br>
                I am also a very detail-oriented person, this makes me able to pick out any errors or mistakes I can find. This can help me easily find discrepancies in my work.
        </p>
            <h1 style="color: yellowgreen; font-size: x-large">My Thanks</h1>
            <p>To wrap it all up I feel like I need to give you my thanks for reading all of this. I have droned on and on about my personal life, so I challenge you to find something about yourself that makes you so great and unique.<br>
            <br>
                Thank you for reading 
                <br>-Sincerely Jason Z</p>
